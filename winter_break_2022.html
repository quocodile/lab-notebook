            visualizations in it that I could use for research. Here is a 
            visualization that I created and ended up putting in the abstract.

                I've verified some of the output for the simulation code for 6 mutations, 2 losses, and the code seems to work well.
                There may be a small chance that the code is overcounting the number of trees in the space though, I'm not quite sure. Will
                be double checking that. If not though, then...

		I've looked into the disagreement between datasets that I saw yesterday, and I found things explaining the problem
                so the situation doesn't look as bad as I thought. Essentially, in the generation of the original dataset, I've
                used parent-child distance to remove duplicate trees generated by pruferSim. However, as it turns out, <strong>parent-child
                distance is completely unusable on k-Dollo phylogenies</strong>. Consider the trees below. While they are obviously different
                trees, the parent-child distance between them is 0. 
                <br><br>
                <img style="height: 150px; width: 300px" class="src" src="./images/parent_child_incorrect.png" alt=""/>
                <br><br>
                I have to do more investigation, and it seems like the only different between the two dataset is that the original dataset 
                is undercounting due to my usage of parent-child distance in the process. It seems, then, that the most accurate dataset
                is the new one generated, as it doesn't undercount due to the same reason as the original dataset. I've been looking more
                into the dataset to validate it, and the results seem promising so far. It may actually be enumerating all the trees in the 
                space of 5 gains, 3 losses.
                <br>
                <br>
                After more investigation, I found things that were pretty big. <strong>Particularly, DISC, ancestor-descendant distance, 
                and CASet all say that the two trees below have a distance of 0</strong>, which is just wrong.
                <br>

                Thought some about simulating trees with multiple mutations being lost. 
                Simulated more trees where one mutation is lost multiple times. I continued
                to look at literature that might help me run experiments on real data. 
                Specifically looked at how MLTED and CASet/DISC experimented on real data.

                After some reviewing of the code, the slowest part of the code is where I compute all the 
                possible permutations of a bit vector that is n*m long, where n is number of losses in 
                one tree and m is the number of losses in the other. This code worked, but it's now too
                slow. I'm now working to create something faster.

                So I spent a lot of time looking at real data. From what I was looking at, I noticed a few things... 
                <ul>
                  <li>Not many real phylogenies exist where the loss is actually labeled.</li>
                  <li>When losses are labeled, there usually isn't more than 1 loss, making GMD useless.</li>
                </ul>
		<br><br>
                However, despite the difficulty of finding trees where losses were represented in a meaningful way,
                trees with parallel mutation might be easier to find. I will link some images here of parallel 
                mutations that are in the tumor phylogenies.

                I mainly ran experiments and thought about how to change the code of GMD
                in order to handle mutation clusters.

                Goals:

                  <li>Fix the experiments that broke yesterday.</li>
                  <li>Run new experiments.</li>
                  <li>Code up a new version of GMD that can handle mutation clusters.</li>
                </ul>
                 Achieved:
                 <br>
                 I was able to continue running several experiments. I also began to code up
                 a new version of heuristicGMD that can handle mutation clusters. As of now, 
                 the code seems to do so, but the weighting schemes still haven't been adjusted
                 yet to accomodate mutation clusters. I'll also need to update the enumerate matchings
                 code to handle mutation clusters. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Aside from that stuff, I also read more of the literature to see how I could perform
                 experiments on real data. I ended up reading through SCARLET, SIFIT, a bit of MP3 and
                 and a bit of SPHyR. I found trees that could be used to evaluate GMD in the supplementary
                 material of SPHyR.

            I am running some experiments on 5 muts, 2 loss 'A', 2 loss 'B'. This
            is the first time I am using clustersHeuristicGMD and clusters_enumerate_matchings
            code as part of the evaluation process. After the experiments are done, I intend
            on verifying them to ensure correctness.

            I briefly looked over the results of the experiments, and they looked correct.
            Aside from that, I also commented and cleaned some code for better documentation.
