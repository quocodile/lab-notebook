            I spent a few hours playing around with d3 to see if I could make 
            visualizations in it that I could use for research. Here is a 
            visualization that I created and ended up putting in the abstract.
            I'm actually quite proud of it.

                I'm also working on tree simulation.

                <strong>Simulation</strong> 
                <br><br>
                I've verified some of the output for the simulation code for 6 mutations, 2 losses, and the code seems to work well.
                There may be a small chance that the code is overcounting the number of trees in the space though, I'm not quite sure. Will
                be double checking that. If not though, then...
                <br>
                <strong>5 mutations, 2 losses (1 mutation lost 2 times) has been simulated.</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>5 mutations, 3 losses (1 mutation lost 3 times) has been simulated.</strong>
                <br>
                TROUBLE: There is disagreement between the space of 5,3 I've generated with this code and past code.

		I've looked into the disagreement between datasets that I saw yesterday, and I found things explaining the problem
                so the situation doesn't look as bad as I thought. Essentially, in the generation of the original dataset, I've
                used parent-child distance to remove duplicate trees generated by pruferSim. However, as it turns out, <strong>parent-child
                distance is completely unusable on k-Dollo phylogenies</strong>. Consider the trees below. While they are obviously different
                trees, the parent-child distance between them is 0. 
                <br><br>
                <img style="height: 150px; width: 300px" class="src" src="./images/parent_child_distance_unusable_k_dollo_proof.png" alt=""/>
                <br><br>
                I have to do more investigation, and it seems like the only different between the two dataset is that the original dataset 
                is undercounting due to my usage of parent-child distance in the process. It seems, then, that the most accurate dataset
                is the new one generated, as it doesn't undercount due to the same reason as the original dataset. I've been looking more
                into the dataset to validate it, and the results seem promising so far. It may actually be enumerating all the trees in the 
                space of 5 gains, 3 losses.
                <br>
                <br>
                After more investigation, I found things that were pretty big. <strong>Particularly, DISC, ancestor-descendant distance, 
                and CASet all say that the two trees below have a distance of 0</strong>, which is just wrong.
                <br>

                <br><br>
                I'm continuing with with simulations. Specifically, trying to simulate 6 gains, 2 losses.
