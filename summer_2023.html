        First group meeting of the summer with Eric, Thea, Jake, and Ethan.
        Discussed the initial documents that I need to review in order to 
        get started this summer. Afterwards, I worked with Thea. First, I forked
        the visualizing clonal trees comps project repository that was stored in 
        Jimmy Zhong's github. I then worked with Thea to figure out why the CASet/DISC
        paper disagreed in the evaluation of the real data trees with the evaluations 
        made by the visualization code. In doing the comparisons again using Layla's implementation
        of CASet and DISC, we found that it was <strong>in fact the paper that had it wrong</strong>.

        Afterwards, Thea and I met with Eric and Layla. They came up with tasks for us to do such as
        creating a 1-sentence and 1-paragraph description of 'What is this Project ?' and 'What do we hope
        to accomplish ?'. In our spare time Layla also wants us to come up with more real data. They also
        noted that we should prioritize implementation things and evaluation.
