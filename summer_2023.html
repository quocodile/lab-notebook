        First group meeting of the summer with Eric, Thea, Jake, and Ethan.
        Discussed the initial documents that I need to review in order to 
        get started this summer. Afterwards, I worked with Thea. First, I forked
        the visualizing clonal trees comps project repository that was stored in 
        Jimmy Zhong's github. I then worked with Thea to figure out why the CASet/DISC
        paper disagreed in the evaluation of the real data trees with the evaluations 
        made by the visualization code. In doing the comparisons again using Layla's implementation
        of CASet and DISC, we found that it was <strong>in fact the paper that had it wrong</strong>.

        <br>
        Afterwards, Thea and I met with Eric and Layla. They came up with tasks for us to do such as
        creating a 1-sentence and 1-paragraph description of 'What is this Project ?' and 'What do we hope
        to accomplish ?'. In our spare time Layla also wants us to come up with more real data. They also
        noted that we should prioritize implementation things and evaluation.

        <br>
        I then read through <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research">The Importance of Stupidity in Research</a>. I also got halfway through a first read of <i>A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation</i>.

          A web-based visualization tool that can be used to better understand evaluations made by tumor tree distance measures.

        <u>1-paragraph summary:</u>
        <br>
        <br>
          An accessible, easy-to-use web-based visualization tool that cancer researchers can use to better understand the 
          differences between two tumor phylogenies as evaluated by various ISA distance measures--CASet, DISC, 
          ancestor-descendant, parent-child. Better understanding the granularity behind the single number offered by 
          these distance measures could be useful in establishing trust in these evaluations. This can help in the adoption
          of these more robust methods of comparing tumor phylogenies by cancer biologists who may have limited command-line
          proficiency. Tasks that may be important to these users might be <u>exploring</u> the areas between trees that cause
          the largest difference between them. In order to appropriately support this task, we need to make instantly interpretable visualizations
          depicting how each mutations contributes to the distance between two tumor phylogenies. It will also be useful for users to <u>query</u>
          a specific mutation to see how it is contributing, and whether it is present in both trees or not. This tool could also be useful to researchers 
          in the area of tumor distance measures.
          A task that might be important to this audience is <u>discovering</u> how features of tree topologies might affect the
          evaluation of a distance measure--depth, branching factor, etc. A useful feature in service of this task could be summary
          statistics that denote the maximum depth and maximum branching factor of each tumor phylogeny.
