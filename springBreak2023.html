        I want to run experiments that compare trees with losses with trees with trees with parallel mutations. 
        <br> Specifically, I want to ask the question of whether CASet+GMD will yield lower distances than CASet.
        <br> I also want to look more into the real data trees CRC1 and CRC2 to make my own intuitive comparisons
        <br> between them. Another thing I want to look into is whether two trees with similar mutation sets but
        <br> vastly different heights will be punished heavily by MP3.
        <br> 
        <br> After some more investigating, I'm wonder if it is the case that MP3 is bad at handling mutatioon clusters.
        <br> After looking at an experiment done in the MP3 paper, it seems that MP3 more severely punishes variances in 
        <br> tree depth. While punishing differences in tree depth seems to be an essential property of a distance measure
        <br> for comparing clonal trees, there remains to be said how severely the punishment should be. One side effect
        <br> of harshly punishing these types of trees is that when two trees have similar mutation sets but one is more clustered,
        <br> that tree is inherently going to be shorter, which may lead to a very severe difference between the two trees. This might
        <br> lead to evaluations that ignore the fact that trees at different resolutions could encode the same time of information.
