        I want to run experiments that compare trees with losses with trees with trees with parallel mutations. 
        <br> Specifically, I want to ask the question of whether CASet+GMD will yield lower distances than CASet.
        <br> I also want to look more into the real data trees CRC1 and CRC2 to make my own intuitive comparisons
        <br> between them. Another thing I want to look into is whether two trees with similar mutation sets but
        <br> vastly different heights will be punished heavily by MP3.
        <br> 
        <br> After some more investigating, I'm wonder if it is the case that MP3 is bad at handling mutatioon clusters.
        <br> After looking at an experiment done in the MP3 paper, it seems that MP3 more severely punishes variances in 
        <br> tree depth. While punishing differences in tree depth seems to be an essential property of a distance measure
        <br> for comparing clonal trees, there remains to be said how severely the punishment should be. One side effect
        <br> of harshly punishing these types of trees is that when two trees have similar mutation sets but one is more clustered,
        <br> that tree is inherently going to be shorter, which may lead to a very severe difference between the two trees. This might
        <br> lead to evaluations that ignore the fact that trees at different resolutions could encode the same time of information.

Over the week, the interesting results that I've gotten from the simulated experiments show that...
            <ul>
            	<li>MLTED issues are resolved by the GMD framework</li>
            	<li>CASet and DISC (union) show patterns (See graph below) similar to MP3</li>
            	<li>CASet and DISC (intersection) don't seem to be effective at comparing tumor trees with different amounts of gains</li>
            </ul>

              </figure>
            <br> 
            Compare this to a graph shown in the MP3 paper.

              </figure>
            <br>
            To help me interpret some of the results, I also did more rereading of varying papers that discuss tumor distance measures. In particular, I learned from the CASet/DISC paper that their intersection variant de-emphasizes different in mutation sets, whereas the union variant should be used when a difference in mutation set should be emphasized. Another thing to note is that it seems the case that differences at the leaves don't seem to strongly affect the distance evaluation of CASet and DISC. This might be problematic as when you have multiple gains/multiple losses, due to various constraints, these gains and losses might be pushed lower in the tree. 
           <br>
           In working with the distance measures, I also notice that MP3 punishes differences in trees pretty severely, with a steeper curve than both CASet and DISC.
            <br>
            When thinking about MLTED, the experiments I ran show that using GMD, we can take MLTED from a point of being unusable on non-ISA trees to being usable again. These are the example trees I tested on when running an experiment to show this:

        I encountered a flaw in the enumeration code, so I spent time fixing it.
        Now I have to consider if I should rerun my experiments. I will consult with Layla.
